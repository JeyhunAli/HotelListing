IN THIS SECTION WE ARE preparing our API for out of the box usage with third party applications.
So we're going to be introducing cores, which is an acronym that stands for

Cross Origin Resource Sharing.

And what this allows us to do is enable our API to be accessed by resource by clients that are not on
the same server.
So right now, I mean everything is happening on our machine.
But just imagine that you've deployed this in your company, maybe to the Internet, and then you said,
Hello everybody, you can use my API to access your information without cores or without a cores policy
in place to facilitate that only other computer, other client apps that are on the same computer as
the API can access that which would defeat the purpose of publishing on the Internet and publishing
for a whole company.
